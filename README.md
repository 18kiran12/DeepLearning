# DeepLearning

Experimenting with deep learning models and other state of the art technologies.

Environment Setup
---

* Setting up tensorflow-gpu, CUDA, cuDNN, gcc compiler etc for Ubuntu 18.04.

Image Classification
---

* CNN Keras CIFAR10 - Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying CIFAR10 image dataset. Keras library was utilized to complete this task

* CNN Tensorflow MNIST - Using tensorflow framework for image classification of simple MNIST image dataset 

* CNN Tensorflow CIFAR10 - Using tensorflow framework for image classification of CIFAR10 dataset. Comparison of performance of different CNN structures 

Machine Translation
---

* German-English Translation - Using an encoder decoder LSTM network for the task of Neural Machine Translation. Keras library was utilized to complete the task.
